Just implementing some of the fun algos/processes I learn about in school.

Projects
===
Linear algebra
---
- [x] Gram-Schmidt process

- [x] Least squares (projection method)

- [ ] Pretty print matrices

- [ ] Least squares (QR method)

- [ ] Least squares (ATA method)

- [ ] Row reduction

- [ ] Determinant from cofactor expansion

Discrete structures
---
Automata

- [x] Convert NFA -> DFA

- [ ] Process input to automata (accept strings)

- [ ] Something interesting with the pumping lemma

Number theory

- [ ] Extended Euclid algorithm

- [ ] Fast exponentiation

- [ ] Compute modular inverse
